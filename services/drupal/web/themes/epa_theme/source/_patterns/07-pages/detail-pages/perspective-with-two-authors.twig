  <p>In celebration of Children’s Health Month, we are excited to kick off this year’s <a href="#">National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week</a> by showcasing <em>Lead Awareness in Indian Country: Keeping our Children Healthy!</em> – a new curriculum to help tribes and communities take the first step in protecting children from potential lead exposure by educating parents and caregivers. The curriculum is a robust set of educational tools that community leaders can use to improve public awareness of the health risks associated with lead exposure and promote actions to reduce this exposure.</p>

  <p>Tribes can face some unique challenges when it comes to lead exposure. Due to their connection and dependence on the environment for the survival of their culture(s) and their subsistence practices, tribal and indigenous populations may have different potential sources of exposure to lead. That’s why we partnered with over 200 tribal representatives to understand the real-life situations these communities are facing and the preventative actions that make the most sense in their daily lives.</p>
  <p>The curriculum uses an impressive design to balance diverse community backgrounds, technical information and localized knowledge to provide community leaders an opportunity to plan and deliver unique messages within each structured module. Instructors with local knowledge will use the curriculum to enhance learning experiences for parents, caregivers and other community members. One way the curriculum does this is by including tribal scenarios and stories, such as the use of lead fishing sinkers and cleanup efforts at Superfund sites to help bring a local awareness and understanding of lead exposure and prevention.</p>
  <p>While focused on tribes, the curriculum is adaptable for all communities. Those who use the curriculum will find it educates participants on simple actions that anyone can take to reduce children’s potential exposure to lead, such as effective cleaning techniques, proper handwashing and good nutrition.</p>
  <p>Protecting children from lead exposure remains a priority for EPA and for all communities. We encourage you to explore the curriculum to learn how to identify sources of and ways to reduce childhood lead exposure in your own community at <a href="#">https://www.epa.gov/lead/tribal-lead-curriculum</a>.</p>
