    heading: 'In order to be in compliance with the lubricity requirements of the ASTM D 975 diesel fuel specification, refineries will have to use lubricity additives, some of which may contain sulfur. Most, if not all, pipelines will likely prohibit the use of these additives in product that they transport. Therefore, these additives will be added to diesel fuel downstream of the pipelines (either into tanks at the terminal or at the rack). Can volumetric calculations be used to account for the sulfur content of these additives?'
