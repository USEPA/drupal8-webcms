    heading: 'Quality Data: An Essential Element of Chemical Safety'
    description: 'Good decisions start with good information. As we work through the process to evaluate any potential risks from chemicals in the marketplace, it’s critical that we have high-quality, robust data on these chemicals. This information is the foundation for our risk evaluations and will ultimately guide our decisions about the risks to public health and the environment and the actions we’ll take to reduce those risks.'

    heading: 'Celebrating a Win-Win: 30 Years of Progress Under the Pollution Prevention Act'
    description: 'On this day in 1990, a new era was ushered in for EPA and the nation when the Pollution Prevention (P2) Act was signed into law.  The act gave the agency new tools to join with states, tribes, and communities to prevent pollution before it happens.  It also marked a shift in the paradigm of environmental protection which had been mostly focused on end-of-pipe pollution control and clean-up strategies.'

    description: 'In celebration of Children’s Health Month, we are excited to kick off this year’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/national-lead-poisoning-prevention-week">National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week</a> by showcasing <em>Lead Awareness in Indian Country: Keeping our Children Healthy!</em> – a new curriculum to help tribes and communities take the first step in protecting children from potential lead exposure by educating parents and caregivers. The curriculum is a robust set of educational tools that community leaders can use to improve public awareness of the health risks associated with lead exposure and promote actions to reduce this exposure.'

    description: 'October is Children’s Health Month, a good reminder that children are often more vulnerable to pollutants than adults due to their differences in behavior and biology, which can lead to greater exposure and unique windows of susceptibility during development.'

    description: 'Businesses are the backbone of the American economy and play a crucial role in protecting our environment for generations to come. This year marks EPA’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary and the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Pollution Prevention (P2) Act. During this time, we’ve worked with businesses to find ways to stop pollution before it is even created, the very heart of P2 and sustainability practices.'

    heading: 'Celebrating Ozone Layer Protection Milestones of the Clean Air Act'
    description: 'Ozone layer protection in the United States reaches an important milestone in 2020. For 30 years the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been helping to protect and heal the Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS). This year marks the start of the final phaseout stage for certain ODS: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, otherwise known as HCFCs. To date, we have reduced production and import of ODS by over 99.5 percent. And, by the end of this decade, we will complete this historic phaseout.'

    description: 'Homeland security is part of our overall national security in the United States. Dating back before 9/11, homeland security officials from all departments and agencies worked to support national preparedness in various forms. Over time, the scope of potential threats to prepare for has expanded beyond large-scale terrorist attacks to also include cyber-attacks, pandemics and catastrophic natural disasters. The evolution of threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation required us to take a broader, more integrated approach to preparedness.'

    heading: 'Advancing Chemical Safety by Listening to You'
    description: 'Like many things in life, the way we work to ensure chemical safety is a process. I’m proud to say we’ve taken some big steps in that process over the past several weeks by issuing our first two final risk evaluations for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/final-risk-evaluation-methylene-chloride">methylene chloride</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/final-risk-evaluation-1-bromopropane">1-bromopropane</a>. Now we’re taking the next step in the process by moving to risk management. This is where we develop a plan to protect public health from the unreasonable risks we found in our final risk evaluations.'

    description: 'As EPA recognizes our many partners as part of EPA’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration, it is vital to highlight partners who touch our lives every day: our agriculture community. Now more than ever, Americans are appreciating the critical role that farmers have in our society. Farmers and ranchers are invaluable partners in fulfilling our mission to protect human health and the environment. We at EPA, with the leadership of Administrator Wheeler, have focused on working hard to enhance and strengthen our partnership with farmers and ranchers.'

The 2016 Lautenberg Act amendments to the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) set the stage for EPA’s work over the past four years to build a new regulatory program from the ground up, informed by the past and inspired by the future.'

    description: 'When you think about how the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention supports EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment, the first thing that might come to mind is our work to review the safety of pesticides and other chemicals. Another important aspect of our work is finding ways to stop pollution before it starts—pollution prevention—and encouraging the development of environmentally friendly products and technologies through green chemistry.'

    description: 'During my tenure at the United States EPA, I have had the pleasure of meeting with many tribes across this beautiful country. I’ve listened carefully to the views, concerns and plans of tribal leaders, and on these visits, I’ve witnessed first-hand the majestic mountains, coastal plains and rugged mesas – to name a few of the geographical features that make up Indian country. As we mark EPA’s 50th anniversary, our commitment to protect human health and the environment in Indian country remains unyielding.'
