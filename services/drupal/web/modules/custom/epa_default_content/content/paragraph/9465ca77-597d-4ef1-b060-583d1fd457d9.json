Flushing only toilet paper helps ensure that the toilets, plumbing, sewer systems and septic systems will continue working properly to safely manage our nation\u2019s wastewater. While EPA encourages disinfecting your environment to prevent the spread of COVID-19, never flush disinfecting wipes or other non-flushable items. These easy steps will keep surfaces disinfected and wastewater management systems working for all Americans.\r\n\r\nPreventable toilet and sewer backups can pose a threat to human health and present an extra challenge to our water utilities and their workforce. Flushing anything other than toilet paper, including disinfecting wipes, can damage internal plumbing, local sewer systems and septic systems. Fixing these backups is costly and takes time and resources away from ensuring that wastewater management systems are otherwise working properly. EPA thanks wastewater utilities and their workforce for their courageous efforts at a time when resources may be stretched thin. Having fully operational wastewater services is critical to containing COVID-19 and protecting Americans from other public health risks. Our nation\u2019s wastewater employees are everyday heroes who are on the frontline of protecting human health and the environment every single day.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/coronavirus.\r\n\r\n<h2>Heading Example<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Heading 3 example<\/h3>\r\n<h4> Heading 4 example<\/h4>\r\n<h5>Heading 5 example<\/h5>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>bullet<\/li><li>bullet<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<ol><li>numbered bullet<\/li><li># bullet<\/li><\/ol>",
