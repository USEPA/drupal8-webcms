Notices must contain:<\/p>\n<p>    A description of the violation that occurred, including the contaminant(s) of concern, and  the contaminant level(s);<br \/>\n    When the violation or situation occurred;<br \/>\n    The potential health effects (including standard required language);<br \/>\n    The population at risk, including subpopulations vulnerable if exposed to the contaminant in their drinking water;<br \/>\n    Whether alternate water supplies need to be used;<br \/>\n    What the water system is doing to correct the problem;<br \/>\n    Actions consumers can take;<br \/>\n    When the system expects a resolution to the problem;<br \/>\n    How to contact the water system for more information; and<br \/>\n    Language encouraging broader distribution of the notice.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of what a Public Notice looks like:<\/p>\n<p>Public Notice: Notification Tiers<\/p>\n<p>EPA specifies three categories, or tiers, of public notification. The delivery timeframe of PN depends on what tier a violation or situation falls into. Each tier has different required methods to deliver the notice depending on water system type. The following table summarizes the differences between PN Tiers:<br \/>\nThe 3 Tiers of Public Notification<\/p>\n<p>\tRequired DistributionTime\tNotification Delivery Method<\/p>\n<p>Tier 1<\/p>\n<p>(Immediate Notice)<\/p>\n<p>Any time a situation occurs where there is the potential for human health to be immediately impacted, water suppliers have 24 hours to notify people who may drink the water about the situation.<\/p>\n<p>Water suppliers must use media outlets such as television, radio, and newspapers, post their notice in public places, personally deliver a notice to their customers, or an alternative method approved by the primacy agency.<\/p>\n<p>Tier 2<\/p>\n<p>(Notice as soon as possible)<\/p>\n<p>Any time a water system provides water with levels of a contaminant that exceed EPA or state standards or that hasn&#039;t been treated properly, but that doesn&#039;t pose an immediate risk to human health, the water system must notify its customers as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the violation.<\/p>\n<p>Notice may be provided via the media, posting, or through the mail.<\/p>\n<p>Tier 3<\/p>\n<p>(Annual Notice)<\/p>\n<p>When water systems violate a drinking water standard that does not have a direct impact on human health (for example, failing to take a required sample on time) the water supplier has up to a year to provide a notice of this situation to its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Tier 3 PN must be delivered the same way as Tier 2 PN. The extra time gives water suppliers the opportunity to consolidate these notices and send them with Annual Water Quality Reports (Consumer Confidence Reports).<br \/>\nCompliance Help<\/p>\n<p>    For Water System Owners and Operators<br \/>\n    For Primacy Agencies<\/p>\n<p>Top of Page<\/p>\n"
