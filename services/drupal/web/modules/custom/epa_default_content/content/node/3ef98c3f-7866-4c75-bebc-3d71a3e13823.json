These illnesses may be severe and sometimes fatal for people with weakened immune systems.Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in drinking water because it is resistant to chlorine and other disinfectants.<\/p>\n<p>The Surface Water Treatment Rules were established to protect against these pathogens. To protect public health, drinking water from lakes, rivers streams and some other sources needs to be treated. This treatment includes disinfection and, in most cases, filtration.<br \/>\nFederal Register Notices:<\/p>\n<p>    Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule; Final Rule (December 16, 1998) | Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, Final Rule (PDF) (44 pp, 500 K, About PDF)<br \/>\n    Revisions to the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), the Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (Stage 1DBPR), and Revisions to State Primacy Requirements to Implement the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments Final Rule (PDF)(11 pp, 278 K, About PDF) (January 16, 2001)<br \/>\n    Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (PDF) (33 pp, 300 K, About PDF) Final Rule (67 FR 1812, January 14, 2002)<br \/>\n    Filter Backwash Recycling Rule Federal Register Notice (20 pp, 241 K, About PDF) (June 8, 2001)<br \/>\n    Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule; Final Rule (133 pp, 4.4 MB, About PDF) (January 5, 2006)<br \/>\n    Correction to January 5, 2006 LT2 FR Notice (January 30, 2006)<br \/>\n    Correction to January 5, 2006 LT2 FR Notice (February 6, 2006)<\/p>\n<p>Top of Page<\/p>\n"
