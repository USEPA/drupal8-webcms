# DNS
# cf. dns.tf alb.tf

# We separate the root domain and subdomains in order to make managing DNS somewhat easier.
# These variables will impact two parts of the configuration:
#
# The load balancer will be configured to listen to one of two hosts:
# 1. If dns-subdomain is set, the Host header must match "${dns-subdomain}.${dns-root-domain}"
# 2. Otherwise, the host header must match dns-root-domain.
#
# The ACM certificate will be generated to match these variables:
# 1. If dns-subdomain is set, the cert will be generated for "${dns-subdomain}.${dns-root-domain}"
# 2. Otherwise, the cert will be generated for dns-root-domain.
#
# The main benefit of separating these two variables is that it opens up the public-facing
# Route 53 zone to manage other records for site DNS from within Terraform or the AWS
# console, rather than having to delegate a single DNS zone to this account.
#
# When using these variables, note that while dns-root-domain is a full domain, the dns-subdomain
# string is just a domain part. That is, to have the ALB listen to "dev.example.com", you
# would specify these variables:
#
# dns-root-domain = "example.com"
# dns-subdomain = "dev"
